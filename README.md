# Freezer Temperature Monitor

IoT system to monitor low-temperature freezer with real-time alerts.

## Technologies
- RP2040 microcontroller (MicroPython)
- Firebase (cloud storage & notifications)
- Android app (Kotlin)

## Features
- Measures and uploads temperature data to Firebase
- Android app displays current temperature
- Alerts when temperature drops below threshold

## Architecture
RP2040 → Firebase → Mobile App

## What I learned
- Integrating hardware (RP2040) with cloud backend
- Mobile app development in Kotlin
- Using Firebase for data storage and real-time notifications

## Screenshots
(add screenshots of app or hardware)
